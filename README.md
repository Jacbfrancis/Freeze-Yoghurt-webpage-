### What I learned

I learnt how to use relatve and absolute positioning to move and place elements in a webpage.


```css
.heading{
    width: 75%;
    left: 100px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 150px;
}
```

```css
middle{
    margin-top: -4px;
    width: 100%;
    height: 1200px;
    position: relative;
}
```


### Continued development

- Building responsive layouts.
- Learn CSS Flexbox.
